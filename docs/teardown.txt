Disassembly sequence for moving NRES from assembled in optics lab

Faro arm, with 2 electrical cables
Faro laptop
Mouse for optical table laptop (just get this out of the way)
power cables for alignment lasers (3)
electrical cables:  fiber stage motor, encoder
                    collimator stage motor, encoder
                    optical bench temperature probe
                    main spectrograph shutter
trifurcated 67-micron fiber, splice box (note orientation)
trifurcated 400-micron fiber
Orion web cam & cable (insert opaque plug in web cam port)
Celestron spotting scope & post
Wedge mirror, mount, & post.  Leave kinematic post mount, safety bracket.
L0 holder/magnetic kinematic mount
ghost baffle (note:  needs tiny metric hex wrench to back off attachment screws)
prism
collimator (add baffle and covers)
CCD  (nominally 9 electrical connections including 3 on power supply, plus
      cryotiger hoses.  Need 3/4 and 2 x 5/8 wrenches to undo cryo couplings.)

X fold mirror & post
