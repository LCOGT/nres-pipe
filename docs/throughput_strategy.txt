This is a description of the strategy for estimating the NRES optical efficiency
vs wavelength, in absolute terms, using the narrow-band filter on the AGU.

The basic idea is to transfer an absolute flux calibration from a standard star
to a flat-field source such as the daytime sky by using the AGU camera, and
then measure the energy detected by the spectrograph when looking at the
flat-field source.  The ratio detected/incident energy is the system efficiency.
This method avoids errors due to uncertainties in estimating coupling losses
at the entrance fiber.  Conversely, coupling losses can be estimated by
comparing measured star fluxes (measured in the stellar spectrum) with 
sky fluxes.

1. Measure the total count rate through the AGU narrow-band filter from
a bright standard star, on a transparent night.  For an exposure time s_AGU,
this yields
ADU/s_AGU = flux_star * Area_tel * Trans_atmos * Trans_telesc * Trans_filter * 
     dlam * AGUDet_effic
 (units) =       erg/cm^2-s-AA * cm^2 * 1 * 1 * 1 * AA * AGUADU/erg = ADU/s

Then the AGUdetector-telescope response is AGUtel_resp = AGUADU/(s_AGU * 
    flux_star * Area_tel * Trans_atmos * Trans_filter * dlam) = AGUADU/erg

2. Measure the flux from some broadband flat-field source (eg daytime sky).
This gives flux_sky = AGUADU/(s_AGU * pixel^2)  (units AGUADU/(s-pix^2)   

3. Measure the area of the stellar pickoff fiber fib_area in units of AGUpix^2, 
using the measuring microscope and the known pixel size in micron.

Then the total energy incident on the spectrograph fiber is given by
  fib_flux = flux_sky * fib_area / AGUtel_resp   (units = erg/s)

4. At the same time as (2), measure (a) the total counts detected in the filter
bandpass by the spectrograph detector, which is
  flux_spec (specADU/s) = sum_lam(I_lam)/s_spec   (units specADU/s), where 
sum_lam means a sum over the wavelength pixels, I_lam is the raw measured 
ADU at each pixel (not flat-fielded), and s_spec is the spectrum exposure time.
Also (b) the effective bandpass of the filter
  dlam (AA) = sum_lam((I_lam * delta_lam)/I_max)
where delta_lam is the wavelength increment at each pixel, and I_max is the
maximum intensity found in the wavelength range containing the filter bandpass.
If the bandpass covers more than one echelle order, the values for different
orders should be summed.

5. Estimate the filter peak transmission Trans_filter in the range [0,1], 
either from test data that comes with the filter, or (better) from lab 
measurement.

6. Estimate the spectrograph detector reciprocal gain gain_spec (e-/ADU) from 
a photon transfer curve, or by some other method.

Then the optical efficiency of the telescope/spectrograph system is
the ratio of the energy detected by the spectrograph to that entering the fiber,
ie

Effic_telspec = flux_spec * gain_spec * h*nu / (fib_flux * s_spec)
