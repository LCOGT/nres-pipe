ThAr to-do list

Get data sets to work on:
*	lab setup double or triple ThAr (applicable to solar time series)
*	lab setup solar spectrum
        sqa double ThAr spectrum

Write and debug avg_triple (or graft it onto avg_flat)
* Transform stellar spectrum line wavelengths table to vacuum.
*Make a new trace file covering 67 orders
*Make a new flat file covering 67 orders
*Find bug that is clobbering spec(*,*,0) for solar data
Make a wavelength solution for lab setup using sun vacuum wavelengths.
Get thar wavelength solution to converge for lab setup, same fiber as above.
Get thar wavelength solution to converge for all fibers.
Understand the solution parameter differences among fibers.  Gamma angle?

Write out description of full calibration strategy.
Make reduced line list(s) containing only matched ThAr lines.  Try fits with
  these.
Test ThAr fits using voting on lab spectra.
Clean obsolete/unnecessary files out of 'reduced' directory.
Do cold starts for sqa, lab spectrographs.
