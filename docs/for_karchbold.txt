For our conversation with Kevin today, here is an outline of the Reduction
Pipeline/Database development.  There are some suggested milestones at the end.

DATA REDUCTION
	Data Flow Definition
		directory structure, calibration data, target data, 
		index files for calibrations, diagnostic data
	Calibration/Extraction
		bias, dark, background sub, cosmic ray, bad pixels, extract,
		statistics, flat-field
	Wavelength Calibration
		bootstrap wavelength solution, ThAr fiber solution, DOUBLE
		calibration, solution for all fibers
	Stellar Classification
		S/N okay? Teff, log(g), log(Z), vsini, RV (rough), binary?
		generate synthetic standard spectra for RV
		execution time okay for pipeline processing
	Radial Velocity Estimation
		star RV solution relative to lab, exposure meter corrections,
		ephemeris corrections, bad data rejection, statistics
	Diagnostic and QC
		measures of spectrograph stability, throughput, repeatability
		of RV, compare star classifications with other groups' results

DATA DISSEMINATION
	Define Functions & Services
		Latham's web page is nominal template
	Database Framework & Platform, Languages
		SQL compatible, probably python, FMW short-term
		schema
	Data Ingestion
		scripts to pull data, tests for completeness, reporting

OPERATIONS
	Calibration Protocol
		bias, dark, tungsten-halogen, double ThAr, choose ZEROs
	Short-Term Characterization & Debugging
		instability timescales, throughput maximization, scheduler
		performance, double scrambler?, tweak performance & debug
	Long-Term QC, Maintenance
		obs of standard stars, inter-site comparisons, script for
		daily quality check

MILESTONES
      * Reduce solar multi-day time series through RV (no classification),
	RV stability better than 100 m/s day-to-day, 30 m/s during day.

      * Classify solar spectrum as sun-like, within loose tolerances

      * Reduce Sedgwick RV for all data on selection of 10 target stars,
	stability better than 30 m/s rms

      * Classify above 10 target stars from Sedgwick spectra, with nominal
	errors relative to standard classifications

      * Pipeline produces all necessary data for database (some faked, maybe),
	successfully ingested automatically for 1 week  

      * Database user interface ready for beta testing

      * 3-night standard star RV time series from BPL, 10 spectra/night, 
        better than 30 m/s rms
