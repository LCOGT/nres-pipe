FORMAT OF NRES PIPELINE OUTPUT FILES    9 Mar 2018


Stellar spectrum output data files produced by the NRES reduction pipeline
will soon have a new format.  We hope this will be both more accurate, more
complete, and easier to use.

Unpacking data sets from the archive will continue to be tedious, as described
immediately below.  Sorry about that.

Data from the archive arrive in a zipped file named for the date of the
transfer, and the number of files contained, eg lcogtdata-20180308-6.

Unzipping this file yields a directory lcogtdata-20180308-6 containing, in
this case, 6 gzipped tar files, each corresponding to an observation requested
from the archive.  These have names like
   lscnrs01-fl09-20180307-0036-e91.tar.gz
   lscnrs01-fl09-20180307-0037-e91.tar.gz
where
   lsc = the observing site: lsc=CTIO, elp=McDonald, cpt=SAAO, tlv=Wise
   nrs0x = which spectrograph; NRES-0 to NRES-4
   20180307 = UT date on which the observation was started
   0036 = The nightly sequence number
   e91 = A code for the reduction level.  e91 = reduced with Banzai pipeline

Unpacking (tar -xzf file.tar.gz) each of these tar files yields a directory
named after the observation, eg lscnrs01-fl09-20180307-0031-e91.  Each such
directory will henceforth contain only 2 files:  the fpacked main data file  
(eg lscnrs01-fl09-20180307-0031-e91.fits.fz)
and the diagnostic plots pdf file
(eg lscnrs01-fl09-20180307-0031-e91.pdf)

Running funpack on the main data file yields the main data file
(eg lscnrs01-fl09-20180307-0031-e91.fits)


Now the interesting part.  The main data file is a multi-extension fits
file containing 10 extensions.  The first of these is essentially only a
header;  the last is a binary table extension.  All the rest are IMAGE
extensions.  Their contents are as follows:

Extn #,name     Data contents             Header keywords

0: --            None            Everything relating to the observation as a
