FORMAT OF NRES PIPELINE OUTPUT FILES    20 Apr 2018


Stellar spectrum output data files produced by the NRES reduction pipeline
will soon have a new format.  We hope this will be both more accurate, more
complete, and easier to use.

Data from the archive arrive in a form that depends on how you acquire it.
Please refer to the archive documentation to understand differences between
downloading your data via a web browser, or with a wget script, or one file
at a time with a Python script, or perhaps other methods.  In any case the
underlying data items are gzipped tar files, each corresponding to an 
individual spectrum exposure.  These have names like
   lscnrs01-fl09-20180307-0036-e91.tar.gz
   lscnrs01-fl09-20180307-0037-e91.tar.gz
where
   lsc = the observing site: lsc=CTIO, elp=McDonald, cpt=SAAO, tlv=Wise
   nrs0x = which spectrograph; NRES-0 to NRES-4
   20180307 = The OBS-DATE date on which the observation was started
      (This date rolls over at a different UT time for each site, such
       that OBS-DATE is fixed during each night of observation.)
   0036 = The nightly sequence number
   e91 = A code for the reduction level.  e91 = reduced with Banzai pipeline

Unpacking (tar -xzf file.tar.gz) each of these tar files yields a directory
named after the observation, eg lscnrs01-fl09-20180307-0031-e91.  Each such
directory will henceforth contain only 2 files:  the fpacked main data file  
(eg lscnrs01-fl09-20180307-0031-e91.fits.fz)
and the diagnostic plots pdf file
(eg lscnrs01-fl09-20180307-0031-e91.pdf)

Running funpack on the main data file yields the main data file
(eg lscnrs01-fl09-20180307-0031-e91.fits)

The main data file is a multi-extension fits
file containing 10 extensions.  The first of these is essentially only a
header;  the last is a binary table extension.  All the rest are IMAGE
extensions.  Their contents are as follows:

Extn #,name     Data contents             Header keywords

0: --            None            Everything relating to the observation as a

                                 instrument setup info, spectrograph environment
                                 readings.  Data unique to this star spectrum:

                                 star and ThAr, telescope lat, long.

             extracted star
             spectrum (NX,NORD)
             (float).  This
             spectrum is the
             most nearly free
             of instrumental

             extracted star

             spectrum has simple
             noise properties,
             and is the one used
