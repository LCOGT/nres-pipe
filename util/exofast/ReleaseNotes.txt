2014/09/16:
 - Minor documentation updates to adhere to published code
 - Updated README to include installation instructions for BJD and 
   ZBARYCORR code
 - Fixed typo in crontab wget script
2014/08/17:
 - Minor documenation clarifications in zbarycorr.pro
2014/07/27:
 - Fixed bug in zbarycorr for obsname handling. Updated documentation 
   and added dependencies to the repo.
2014/07/23:
 - updates to zbarycorr to include shapiro delay and better
   documentation, rename rvbarycorr to barycorr, and removed debugging
   stuff from jdutctojdtdb.
2014/07/15:
 - Added time utlilities (e.g., UTC2BJD) and barycenter correction code
   (zbarycorr.pro and rvbarycorr.pro) to the repo.
2012/02/26:
 - Detrending broke in 2013/12/05 update. Fixed here.
 - When a period prior is given, the RV fit no longer does
   lomb-scargle -- it only tries that period.
 - In EXOFAST_PREFITRV, add degree of freedom when period is given
 - In EXOFAST_GETMCMCSCALE, changed print statement to message statement
2013/02/08: 
 - Fixed typo in primary transit probabilities. Previously, results
   were incorrectly multiplied by Rstar/Rsun (probabilities were
   correct for secondary transit probabilities).
2013/02/04:
 - Update URLs to now-published paper:
   http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013PASP..125...83E
 - Changed filenames for stromgren limb darkening save files so they
   are unique for case-insensitive filesystems (e.g., Mac OSX)
 - EXOFAST_PREFITRV now returns -1 if no fit is found.
 - Minor documentation updates
2013/01/14:
 - Updated URL of exoplanets.csv in readexo.pro for recent changes to
   exoplanets.org.
 - For future notifications of updates, follow @exofastupdates on
   twitter https://twitter.com/exofastupdates
2013/01/03:
 - Fixed minor bugs that broke the example in the README for HAT-P-3b.
2012/12/19:
 - Several fixes for eccentric, transit-only fits (requires logg
   prior). These types of fits are very slow (~1% acceptance rate) due
   to the degeneracy of ecosw. Fitting a secondary simultaneously
   should fix that, but is untested. Eccentric, transit-only fits should
   still be interpreted with extreme caution because it assumes the
   mass of companion is negligible and the stellar mass from Torres
   (and therefore logg, Teff, [Fe/H]) is correct.
   NOTE: Rough errors (i.e., prior widths) from the KIC are
   sigma_Teff~150 K, sigma_logg~0.3, sigma_[Fe/H]~0.2, but it depends
   on the type of star. Some have catastrophic errors.
   See Brown et al., 2011, http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AJ....142..112B 
 - Most important, now models where e >= (1-Rstar/a) are excluded,
   since they would have a periastron inside the star, instead of e <
   1 as the previous constraint. This is still conservative, as the
   ignored tidal effects will be important before this limit, but it
   solves some numerical problems for poorly constrained
   eccentricities. High-eccentricity models should be viewed with
   skepticism, as they are likely to be influenced by tides.
 - Print Carter et al., 2008 error estimates when only best-fit is done 
   See http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...689..499C, eqs 19 & 23
 - More intuitive outputs when chain isn't well-mixed (now show the
   index to original parameter array, not the subset of fitted parameters).

2012/12/09:
 - Change step size in cosi for initial AMOEBA fit to rstar/a, instead
   of 0.1. This means the step size, which is approximately the range
   of parameter space it will explore, corresponds to an impact
   parameter of 1. This is a dramatic improvement for long-period
   planets, where the previous step size would force it to explore
   primarily non-transiting solutions.
 - Added additional output files -- the model for each input time.

2012/12/05:
 - Major upgrade makes EXOFAST more compatible with Kepler data
 - Added support for Long Cadence (and arbitrary cadence) data
 - Better handling of quadratic limb darkening that takes into account
   the theoretical uncertainties of the Claret and Bloeman 2011 limb
   darkening tables, based on their Fig 1 (see eq 26, Section 5.2 of
   Eastman et al, 2013 for discussion).
 - EXOFAST_ROSSITER now adheres to sign conventions.
 - Added (unintegrated) CUDA code (thanks Eric Ford!). See new
   exofast/cuda directory. Still needs work, but a good starting
   point for interested parties.

 - Added debug checkbox online to output stderr (to help diagnose problems)

2012/07/12:
 - Fixed major bug in prior widths of Mstar/Rstar. Fits using versions
   prior to this update will have underestimated errors in Mstar,
   Rstar, and derived quantities.

2012/06/28:
 - Updates for compatiblity with Windows and IDL v6.1.  

2012/06/25:
 - Public release
