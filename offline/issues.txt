Things wrong with thar_triple & assoc routines:

Arguably, these should work on blaze-corrected spectra, not flat-fielded.
Do we have blaze-corrected arc spectra?  Maybe just extracted is fine.

Since the triple code works on extracted spectra, it shouldn't be hard to
substitute the stage2 thar-fitting code for the muncha code now used.

It may be wise to reset the starting conditions before solving for each of
the 4 fibers, since results appear so much worse for the last 3 fibers than
for the first.  Doing the substitution above may make this moot.

I think the stage2 code is speedier than the muncha code, which also argues
for substututing.

In the process, might as well replace the muncha thar-fitting code as well.

*Done* 
Comments in one of the fit_something.pro code are messed up, and tell lies
about the function of the tharlist keyword.  Fix this.
