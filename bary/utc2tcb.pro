; NAME:
;   UTC2TCB
; PURPOSE:
;   Converts a universal coordinate time JD (JD_UTC) to a Barycentric
;   Coordinate Time JD (JD_TCB) with an accuracy of ~1 us. JD_TCB is
;   often referred to by the less strictly defined "BJD" (see notes
;   below).
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE
;   JD_TCB = UTC2TCB(jd_utc, ra, dec, lat, lon, elevation,
;                    obsname=obsname, tbase=tbase, /1950, /TIME_DIFF,
;                    /UPDATE, /NOUPDATE)
;
; INPUTS:
;   JD_UTC     - A scalar or array of JDs (in UTC). Must be double
;                precision
;   RA/DEC     - A scalar specifying the Right Ascension and
;                Declinatoin of the object, in decimal degrees. J2000
;                is assumed unless /B1950 is set
;   
; OPTIONAL INPUTS:
;   LAT/LON    - The latitude and longitude of the observatory, in
;                decimal degrees. Longitude is west. If LAT/LON and
;                OBSNAME are not specified, the center of the
;                earth will be assumed and the resultant accuracy will
;                be ~20 us. If OBSNAME is set, these are ignored.
;   ELEVATION  - The elevation of the observatory, in meters. If
;                LAT/LON are not set, or if OBSNAME is set, this will
;                be ignored. Sea level is assumed if not given.
;   OBSNAME    - A string input to OBSERVATORY.PRO that specifies an
;                observatory. If set, LAT/LON/ELEVATION are ignored.
;   TBASE      - A scalar or n_elements(JD) vector that is the
;                baseline subtracted from the input JDs. For highest
;                precision, TBASE = floor(jd) is recommended
;
; OPTIONAL KEYWORDS:
;   B1950      - If set, the input coordinates are assumed to be in equinox 
;                B1950 coordinates. Default is the J2000 equinox.
;   TIME_DIFF  - To return the difference in seconds instead (either
;                to have the offset or for higher precision), use this
;                keyword. 
;                TCB = UTC + utc2tcb(jd,ra,dec,/time_diff)/86400.d0
;   UPDATE     - For accurate results, current empirical data must
;                be used. Set this keyword to spawn wget to download
;                the most recent data file (tai-utc.dat). This is
;                only necessary (but critical) when leap seconds are added.
;
; OUTPUTS:
;   JD_TCB     - The light travel time corrected, Barycentric Coordinate
;                Time (TCB) in JD for each given UTC. If /TIME_DIFF is
;                set, then returns the time difference in seconds.
;                TCB = utc2tcb(jd_utc,ra,dec)
;                TCB = UTC + utc2tcb(jd_utc,ra,dec,/time_diff)/86400.d0
; 
; DESCRIPTION:
;   TCB time is the current time standard (as of 2009). This routine
;   follows the procedure here:
;   http://lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov/users/craigm/bary/
;   but ignores the dispersion correction. TCB is defined:
;   TCB = TOBS + GEOMETRIC + CLOCK + EINSTEIN - SHAPIRO
;
;   where
;
;     TOBS      - the observed JD in UTC of the event on Earth
;     GEOMETRIC - the light travel time from your position on earth to
;                 the barycenter of the solar system (~300 s)
;     CLOCK     - the number of leap seconds since 1961 + 32.184 (~60 s)
;     EINSTEIN  - the relativistic correction due to using the earth
;                 as your inertial frame (~1 ms)
;     SHAPIRO   - the time delay due to photon bending in the
;                 potential of the solar system (~1 us)
;
;   This correction has been verified to ~1 us accuracy and may be
;   accurate to ~30 ns. However, great care must be exercised to get
;   even ~1 minute accuracy.
;
;   *** PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING NOTES ABOUT ACCURACY CAREFULLY ***
;
;   NOTES (in order of accuracy of result):
;
;   This routine transparently handles the conversion from UTC to TT.
;   Using TT will produce a systematic offset equal to the number of
;   leapseconds required plus 32.184 seconds (66.184 seconds in 2009). 
;
;   HELIO_JD.PRO, BARYCEN.PRO, and many routines that calculate the
;   position of astronomical objects assume the input "JD" is "JD_TT",
;   a critical assumption that is not obvious to users unfamiliar with
;   the complexities of precision timing. This has likely led to the
;   fact that the term "BJD" has been used in the literature to mean
;   both "BJD_UTC" and "BJD_TT" (similarly for "HJD"), which differ by
;   ~1 minute! BJD_UTC and HJD_UTC are not continous, uniformly
;   increasing timescales and should never be used in astronomy.
;
;   Leap seconds are added unpredicably every ~2 years. A current file
;   is vital for ~1 second accuracy. Set the /UPDATE keyword to wget
;   the latest file or manually retrieve it from
;   ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/tai-utc.dat and put it in $ASTRO_DATA
;
;   UTC and UT may differ by as much as 0.9s (the difference between
;   "delta t" and leap seconds + 32.184). The only acceptable input
;   is JD in UTC time. UTC is returned by NTP servers, and is usually
;   the value recorded in image headers, but this should not be assumed.
;
;   For it to take into account your position on the earth, LAT and
;   LON, or OBSNAME must be specified. If none of these are set, the
;   assumed position is the center of the earth, and the results will
;   be accurate to ~20 ms. This correction agrees with naive estimates
;   (spherical earth at noon on the winter solstice at -23.5
;   degrees latitude and 0 longitude) to 2 ms. Based on this and a
;   handful of similar tests, this program is believed to accurately
;   implement Craig Marquardt's routines, which are reported to be
;   limited by the GPS coordinates of your observatory.
;
;   For ~100 us accuracy, double precision cannot hold the full
;   JD. TBASE=floor(jd) should be used.
;
;   ELEVATION or OBSNAME should be set to account for the light travel
;   time to your elevation. If not set, the elevation is assumed to be
;   at sea level and results will be accurate to ~10 us.
;
;   This program, with no observatory specified and using
;   TBASE=2400000.5 agrees within 10 ns with BARYCEN.PRO (with
;   appropriate inputs). The documentation for BARYCEN.PRO says it
;   agrees with fxbary to 1 us, but neither take into account your
;   position on the earth, which is a ~20 ms effect. For this reason,
;   this program is believed to be accurate to at least ~1 us.
;
;   *** CORRECTIONS BEYOND ~1 us ACCURACY HAVE NOT BEEN VERIFIED AT ALL ***
;
;   For ~100 ns accuracy, the correction should be returned in seconds
;   using the /TIME_DIFF keyword and applied carefully.
;
;   For better than ~30 ns, the corrections are limited by the
;   imperfect knowledge of your location with respect to the center of
;   the earth (~10 m). A slight modification of this code to use ITRF
;   measurements of your position on earth (ie from VLBI) will be
;   required. Further verification of this routine at that level is
;   strongly recommended, and heroic measures to ensure double
;   precision is adequate may be required.
;
; DEPENDENCIES:
;   IDL astronomy library
;
;   an environment variable "ASTRO_DATA", which specifies that path to
;   tai-utc.dat and JPLEPH.405, which can be found here:
;   ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/tai-utc.dat
;   http://www.physics.wisc.edu/~craigm/idl/down/JPLEPH.405

;
; REVISION HISTORY:
; 2009/12/10: Written by Jason Eastman (OSU)
; Based heavily on BARYCEN.PRO by goehler -- major differences are:
;   uses JD_UTC as input
;   allows wgetting of leap second file required to convert to TT
;   allows user settable TBASE for higher precision
;   uses your position on earth for higher precision (see notes)
